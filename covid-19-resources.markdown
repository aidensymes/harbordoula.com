During this time of uncertainty and constant change, I continue to support birthing people and new parents remotely. With so much discussion about what what we can't do, where we can't go and who we can't see, we are forgetting all of the things that we **can** do. You can birth with less fear, welcome your baby with joy and get the postpartum support you need! Contact me to discuss options in care and pricing.
