blurb: 
about: "har·bor\n/ˈhärbər/\n\nnoun\n\na place on the coast where vessels may find
  shelter, especially one protected from rough water by piers, jetties, and other
  artificial structures.\n\nWelcome!\nI hope you find a safe place to find your voice
  and strength at Harboe Doula Care. I'm Jennifer Symes, DONA trained Birth and Postpartum
  Doula. My goal is to create a supportive, safe space for birthing families to find
  shelter. Pregnancy, childbirth and the first newborn weeks are different for everyone.
  As your doula, I can help you find the path that works best for you and your baby.
  I provide non-judgmental care, education, hands-on support and encouragement. My
  background in Early Childhood Education and Psychology as well as my experience
  as a parent to four amazing children, lead me to doula work. I am passionate about
  the rights and needs of birthing people and for this reason, I limit the number
  of clients I take to ensure that I have the time needed to spend with each. My skills
  include basic breastfeeding support, Infant and Adult CPR and First Aid Certification.\n\nPlease,
  feel free to reach out to me so we can discuss your individual needs and wishes. "
