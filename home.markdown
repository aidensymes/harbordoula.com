about-intro: "Welcome to Harbor Doula Care!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n\n\n\nI'm
  Jennifer Symes, CD(DONA) Birth and Postpartum Doula. \n\nCongratulations on this
  new adventure! I look forward to discussing how we can work together to create a
  nurturing space for you and your family.\n\nIn response to changing policies and
  safety measures due to covid-19, I am offering services virtually. We can schedule
  a full support package, a one time session or something in between. You don't have
  to face these challenges without preparation and support."
about: "Pregnancy, childbirth and the newborn weeks come with great joy, transitions
  and challenges. As your Doula, I can help you find what works best for you and your
  baby. I provide non-judgmental care, education, hands-on support and encouragement
  as you navigate this journey of parenthood. Whether this is your first baby or your
  fifth, Doula care offers you the personalized support that you need. \n\nPeople
  often ask why I decided to become a Doula.  A lifetime of choices lead me here.
  Working with children and families has always been a big part of my life. Professionally,
  my background is in Early Childhood Education and Psychology, both as a teacher
  and an administrator of childcare programs. Personally, I am the proud parent of
  four children, learning parenting lessons daily. What’s true of most parents is
  that along with the joy, they sometimes feel nervous, lonely or just plain tired.
  And I’ve found that this is the case whether your baby is in utero or high school.
  I am here to listen and help solve the problems you encounter from pregnancy through
  the postpartum months. I am also here to celebrate your victories and cheer you
  on! When you are supported in this journey, I believe you are the parent your child
  deserves. \n\nMy philosophy is simple: I provide the resources you need to make
  informed decisions, as well as the tools to implement those plans, but ultimately,
  the decisions are yours. \n\nI continue to take workshops on a variety of topics
  that help me better serve my clients, including childbirth education, breastfeeding,
  pelvic floor health and trauma informed birth support. I hold current certifications
  in Infant and Adult CPR and First Aid.\n\nInviting someone into your birth space
  and your life is a very personal decision. The best way to know if we would make
  a good team is for us to talk. I'd love to schedule a free consultation to discuss
  your individual needs and wishes. "

testimonials:
- quote: Jennifer was such a huge help for our family postpartum. With two school
    age children, our lives were already hectic before the arrival of baby number
    three. As I recovered from my first c-section birth and our family navigated the
    somewhat bumpy transition from family of four to family of five, Jennifer’s visits
    were a welcome relief. My newborn was slow to gain weight at first and Jennifer
    confidently stepped in with helpful nursing tips, calls to lactation and other
    specialists and, best of all, as a caring and experienced listener. She was quick
    to respond to my calls and texts and was such a reassuring presence in our home.
    Her visits allowed me to get some much-needed rest, my big kids adore her, and
    she left me feeling confident that our family would indeed find our new normal.
    I’m so glad that we had Jennifer’s loving help to welcome our new baby!

- quote: Jennifer Symes is an amazing Doula! Having her around was a tremendous help.
    Although my labor did not go as planned, she was very attentive and helped me
    to become as comfortable as possible. She assisted me with different techniques
    to help manage my labor. During my pregnancy and childbirth Jennifer was available
    to answer any questions that arose. My partner expressed many times being grateful
    for her presence. Having her there gave my partner the opportunity to rest after
    working a double shift and know I was in good hands. Postpartum Jennifer continues
    to make herself available if needed. I would highly recommend Jennifer and would
    definitely reach out to her in a heartbeat shall we decide to extend our family.
    Thank you again Jennifer!
  person: "— Natasha B."
- quote: I was so grateful that I had Jennifer's help. She helped me on a pragmatic
    and emotional level. Logistically, Jennifer just knew what to do without needing
    much direction. During that time I had a little anxiety and I wanted everything
    in my physical environment to be just so to help me feel more in control... Jennifer
    helped keep my physical environment orderly and clean so I could enjoy my little
    one. I remember one afternoon I got lightheaded and laid down to rest. Jennifer
    got my baby to sleep and when I woke up rested, my trash was taken out, my dishes
    were done, and there was a beautiful note telling me what a great job I was doing.
    I felt like an angel just took over and I could let go for some time. Emotionally,
    Jennifer listened to my concerns about being a new mom and helped me to process
    them. I felt lighter and more reassured after our conversations. Jennifer listened
    in a way that did not feel like she was trying to fix me; she was present, accepting,
    and nurturing. And she helped me to laugh which I definitely needed. Jennifer
    truly cared...  I would wholeheartedly recommend Jennifer as a doula. My husband
    and I are planning on having a second child and I will certainly hire Jennifer
    again.
