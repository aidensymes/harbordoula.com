blurb: Caring Support Before, During and After Your Baby's Birth. Serving Boston,
  Northshore and Southern NH.
about: "har·bor\n/ˈhärbər/\n\nnoun\n\na place on the coast where vessels may find
  shelter, especially one protected from rough water by piers, jetties, and other
  artificial structures.\n\nWelcome!\nI'm Jennifer Symes, DONA trained Birth and Postpartum
  Doula. My goal is to create a supportive, safe shelter for birthing families. Pregnancy,
  childbirth and the first newborn weeks are different for everyone. As your doula,
  I can help you find the path that works best for you and your baby. I provide non-judgmental
  care, education, hands-on support and encouragement. My background in Early Childhood
  Education and Psychology, as well as my experience as a parent to four amazing children,
  lead me to doula work. I am passionate about the rights and needs of birthing people
  and for this reason, I limit the number of clients I take to ensure that I have
  the time needed to spend with each. My skills include breastfeeding support, Infant
  and Adult CPR and First Aid Certification.\n\nPlease, feel free to reach out to
  me so we can discuss your individual needs and wishes. "

testimonials:
- quote: Jennifer was such a huge help for our family postpartum. With two school
    age children, our lives were already hectic before the arrival of baby number
    three. As I recovered from my first c-section birth and our family navigated the
    somewhat bumpy transition from family of four to family of five, Jennifer’s visits
    were a welcome relief. My newborn was slow to gain weight at first and Jennifer
    confidently stepped in with helpful nursing tips, calls to lactation and other
    specialists and, best of all, as a caring and experienced listener. She was quick
    to respond to my calls and texts and was such a reassuring presence in our home.
    Her visits allowed me to get some much-needed rest, my big kids adore her, and
    she left me feeling confident that our family would indeed find our new normal.
    I’m so glad that we had Jennifer’s loving help to welcome our new baby!

- quote: Jennifer Symes is an amazing Doula! Having her around was a tremendous help.
    Although my labor did not go as plan, she was very attentive and helped me to
    become as comfortable as possible. She assisted me with different techniques to
    help manage my labor. During my pregnancy and childbirth Jennifer was available
    to answer any questions that arose. My partner expressed many times being grateful
    for her presence. Having her there gave my partner the opportunity to rest after
    working a double shift and know I was in good hands. Postpartum Jennifer continues
    to make herself available if needed. I would highly recommend Jennifer and would
    definitely reach out to her in a heartbeat shall we decide to extend our family.
    Thank you again Jennifer!

- quote: When my husband was not present for the first three weeks of my baby's life
    due to serving in the National Guard I was so grateful that I had Jennifer's help.
    She helped me on a pragmatic and emotional level. Logistically, Jennifer just
    knew what to do without needing much direction. During that time I had a little
    anxiety and I wanted everything in my physical environment to be just so to help
    me feel more in control. Although I know this form of control is illusionary Jennifer
    helped keep my physical environment orderly and clean so I could enjoy my little
    one. I remember one afternoon I got lightheaded and laid down to rest. Jennifer
    got my baby to sleep and when I woke up rested, my trash was taken out, my dishes
    were done, and there was a beautiful note telling me what a great job I was doing.
    I felt like an angel just took over and I could let go for some time. Emotionally,
    Jennifer listened to my concerns about being a new mom and helped me to process
    them. I felt lighter and more reassured after our conversations. Jennifer listened
    in a way that did not feel like she was trying to fix me; she was present, accepting,
    and nurturing. And she helped me to laugh which I definitely needed. Jennifer
    truly cared. She came by twice after my husband got home just to make sure we
    were transitioning okay into being parents together. She was always available
    to talk when I needed her. I would wholeheartedly recommend Jennifer as a doula.
    My husband and I are planning on having a second child and I will certainly hire
    Jennifer again.
